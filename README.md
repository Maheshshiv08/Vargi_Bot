e-Yantra Robotics Competition is about sensitizing students to look into problems around them to devise solutions as engineers. In the previous versions of the competition, we’ve encouraged young engineers to look into issues in domains such as: Agriculture, Urban Services, Warehouse Automation, Space Exploration, Jungle Safari, Disaster Management and so on.

We, at e-Yantra wholeheartedly believe that automation and robotics are the present and future of our society. This is cemented by the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) that enables our industries to automate the manufacturing processes. Hence, we are here yet again in another version of e-Yantra Robotics Competition and invite you to help us devise novel systems to aid in Industry 4.0. We will not only use smart technologies to automate processes like packaging and delivery in an industry scenario but also check the ‘quality’ of the goods produced. We will also diagnose the issues in the industry equipment without any human intervention which is an integral part of the Industry automation. Moreover, through the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and FPGA, we will be able to have better machine-to-machine communication and improve self-monitoring too.

At the end of the competition, we hope you will look at the current practices in this Industry Revolution with a new perspective and help us explore improved solutions to address difficult challenges faced.

All Themes have two Stages:
# Stage 1: Preparing for Automation
Teams learn software, concepts and conduct experiments to get ready for implementing their solutions.

# Stage 2: Implementing the Theme
Selected Teams go on to implement their full-fledged solution conforming to the rules provided in the rulebook (Detailed Rulebook will be provided in Stage 2).
